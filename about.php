        Patan Multiple Campus is the only constituent campus of T.U in Lalitpur district, the second largest city in the valley. It was formally founded on 17th Bhadra, 2011 B.S, and it was then named as "Patan Inter College".  The college was inaugurated by the then crown prince His Majesty Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah on Bhadra 31, 2021 BS.

        Several educationists had tirelessly worked for the establishment of the college in Lalitpur district. They include: Prof. Mangal Raj Joshi, Prof. Asharam Shakya, Mr. Kamal Mani Dixit, Prof. Hem Raj Joshi, Mr. Indra Raj Mishra, Mr. Pradhumna Lal Joshi, Mr. Bhairab Bahadur Pradhan, Mr. Raj Bahadur Chipalu, and Laxmi Prasad Rimal.

      <p class="p-color text-justify">
        After the implementation of national education system, the Patan Inter College was renamed as Patan Multiple Campus on Shravan 1, 2030 BS. Since then the campus has been functioning as a constituent campus of the T.U. In accordance with the 2055 Decentralization Act of the TU, the campus has entered into decentralization since 2056 BS. Twenty-five students, including a girl, were at the Patan Inter College at the time of its foundation. However, as a result of the educational awareness in the people of Lalitpur, and also because of the efforts of the campus administration, now the campus is successful in conducting Bachelor and Degree level programmes in the Morning, Day and Evening shifts in Humanities, Science and Management. At present, 306 teachers and 116 employees are directly involved as the human resources for the smooth functioning of different level programmes.
